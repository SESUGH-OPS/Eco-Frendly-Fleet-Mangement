# AZUBI TASK ON AUTO SCALING POLICIES
You've been tasked with creating a flexible infrastructure for an eco-friendly car-sharing service. The service should automatically adapt to varying usage demands while keeping costs in check.

## Guidelines/Goals:
- **Launch EC2 instances using a predefined AMI.**

- **Create an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute traffic.**

- **Create an Auto Scaling Group for the EC2 instances,configuring scaling policies to add/remove instances based on CPU utilization**

- **The scaling policies configured above, should consider cost optimization and minimize instances during periods of low demand.**
